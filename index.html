            <h1>Javascript Coding Quiz!</h1>
            <p>
                This quiz will ask you a series of Javascript code-related questions.
                Try to answer them all within the time limit. Finishing the quiz faster
                will give you a better score, but each wrong answer will subtract five seconds
                from your remaining time. Don't worry, the questions are multiple-choice.
