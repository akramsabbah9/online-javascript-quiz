# Online Javascript Quiz

## Description

Welcome to my JavaScript-powered JavaScript Coding Quiz! This is a browser-based application that tests the user's knowledge of coding. This quiz uses JavaScript to dynamically-update the HTML elements and their CSS styling, allowing the user to interact with the entire quiz without reloading the page.

In addition to multiple-choice questions, this quiz also uses a timer that will end the current attempt upon reaching zero. A time penalty will be incurred when the user selects an incorrect answer.

When the user finishes an attempt, they can save their initials and score to localStorage. The high score page retrieves this data to display scores in descending order.
